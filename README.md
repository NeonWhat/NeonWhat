## About Me
-  Hi, I’m **Neon**, professional button masher and full-time victim of my potato PC.  
  yes its a Ryzen 5 with Radeon graphics APU proudly identifying himself as **“AuthenticAMD”** on my engine,  
  but in reality it’s better suited for fucking corpo spreadsheets than actual games.  
  (Even my own engine looks at me like.. *“bro… why??”*... I have proof!)  
  
-  Interested in ... *literally anything*, even rocks.  
-  Currently learning ... *Nothing special really*, unless "forgetting instantly" counts as a skill.  
-  Collaborating on ... *My Neo Engine*, basically my little science experiment that somehow works and loads an entire city on my pc Without crashing my "Non-existent GPU".
-  How to reach me: I advise you to contact me on newgrounds as I am more active here: newgroundsProfile → **https://neonc-137.newgrounds.com** 
u can also use my workplace email → **acountlinkedcmd@gmail.com** (email me bro, don’t fax me [NOT ADVISABLE]).
-  Pronouns: **He/She/Wot??** (depends on FPS and wether my "Non-existent GPU" crashes or not).  
-  Fun fact: **FUCK EMANI** (don’t ask, just accept teh truth).
-  (btw if u see a guy wearing a bagpack like Marcus Holloway from watch dogs does.. or with a pc and a bag like that.. 
TELL him I said hi JORGE!)
