## About Me
-  Hi, I’m **Neon**, professional button masher and full-time victim of my potato PC.  
  yes its a Ryzen 5 with Radeon graphics APU proudly identifying himself as **“AuthenticAMD”** on my engine,  
  but in reality it’s better suited for fucking corpo excel shit than actual games.  
  
-  Interested in ... *literally anything*, even rocks.  
-  Currently learning ... *Nothing special really*, unless "forgetting instantly" counts as a skill.  
-  Collaborating on ... *My Neo Engine*, basically my little science experiment that somehow works on my pc Without crashing my "Non-existent GPU".
-  How to reach me: I advise you to contact me on newgrounds as I am more active here: newgroundsProfile → **https://neonc-137.newgrounds.com** 
u can also use my workplace email [NOT ADVISABLE] → **acountlinkedcmd@gmail.com** (email me bro, don’t fax me [Death threats are allowed]).
-  Pronouns: **He/She/Wot??** 
-  Fun fact: **FUCK EMANI**!
-  (btw if u see a guy wearing a bagpack like Marcus Holloway from watch dogs does.. or with a pc and a bag like that..
